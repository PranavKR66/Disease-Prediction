# Disease-Prediction

**The purpose of this assignment is to predict whether a patient has a disease based on biological information about the patient such
as age and height. We will exlore and process the data in order to prepare it to be used to train machine learning algorithms. 
This is a binary classification problem. Therefore we will use a number of classification algorithms to make the prediction. 
We have a training dataset to train the machine learning algorithms and a testing dataset in order to test the predictions made by 
the algorithms.**
