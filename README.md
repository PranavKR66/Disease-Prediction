# Disease-Prediction

**The purpose of this assignment is to predict whether a patient has a disease based on biological information about the patient such
as age and height. A summary of the steps taken are as follows:**

- **Performed exploratory data analysis in Python on a medical data set consisting of 50,000 rows, using statistical analysis and visualization. Performed feature engineering by adding a Body Mass Index attribute.**
- **Implemented machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Na√Øve Bayes,K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Networks.**
- **Applied the voting classifier to aggregate the results of several machine learning models.**
- **Used Grid Search and k-fold cross validation to tune the hyper-parameters in order to optimize the recall and accuracy of the models. Made predictions with accuracy and recall values of around 74 percent.**
